    <p>The tributes above are displayed directly from a curated collection. If you have submitted a memory via the "Share Your Memory" page, it will be reviewed by the site administrator before being considered for inclusion.</p>
    
    <h4>Making it Easier to Read:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Alternating Row Colors:</strong> This can be set by the site administrator directly within the source Google Sheet (using the "Format > Alternating colors" menu). We recommend choosing light text on darker, subtly different background shades to match our site's theme.</li>
        <li><strong>Text & Column Widths:</strong> Text wrapping and appropriate column widths for readability are also best managed within the Google Sheet itself before it's published.</li>
    </ul>
