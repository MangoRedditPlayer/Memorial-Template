## Shared Memories of {{ site.memorial_settings.deceased_name }}

This is where tributes, stories, photos, and videos shared by family and friends will be displayed.

In Phase 2, we will integrate a system here (like Disqus or another commenting platform specified in `_config.yml`) to allow visitors to share their memories directly and see them appear below.

*(The chosen third-party service's embed code will go here later, potentially using `site.disqus_shortname` from _config.yml)*
